1. The program is not running properly. Hint: `Invariant Violation: Module AppRegistry is not a registered callable module (calling runApplication). A frequent cause of the error is that the application entry file path is incorrect.`.

   The `main.jsbundle` file may not be generated properly. You need to check that the files for programs such as` env.ts` `version.ts` already exist. If no, run the script to generate the file.

   ```sh
   yarn run generate
   ```

2. On the selection of react-native version.

   Repo **[README.md](./README.md)** instructions suggest that developers use `0.68.0` or below, which is the instructions for the warehouse's `example` project. If the user creates a new project or an existing project, we only require the minimum version. The lowest version needs to be higher than `0.63.5`.
