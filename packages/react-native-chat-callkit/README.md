# Introduction

AgoraChatCallKit is an open-source audio and video UI library developed based on Agora's real-time communications and signaling services. With this library, you can implement audio and video calling functionalities with enhanced synchronization between multiple devices. In scenarios where a user ID is logged in to multiple devices, once the user deals with an incoming call that is ringing on one device, all the other devices stop ringing simultaneously.
